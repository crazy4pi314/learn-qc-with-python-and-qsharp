# GitHub Actions Configuration

The files in this folder are used to configure GitHub Actions for use with the code samples in this repository.
For example, `build-devcontainer.yml` provides GitHub with instructions on how to prebuild and deploy these samples so that it is quicker for you to get started learning quantum computing.
If you're interested in how these actions work, please read more on the [GitHub Actions documentation site](https://help.github.com/en/actions).
